### Project: DeepSea-EDNA: An AI-Driven eDNA Analysis for Deep-Sea Biodiversity
# Introduction
This project develops an AI-driven pipeline to analyze deep-sea eDNA, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods that rely on incomplete reference databases. Our solution uses deep learning and unsupervised learning to accurately classify, annotate, and estimate the abundance of eukaryotic taxa, including undiscovered species, directly from raw eDNA sequences. We are also creating a specialized website for public access to the data and tools.

# Problem Statement
The primary challenge in deep-sea eDNA analysis is the lack of comprehensive deep-sea organism sequences in existing reference databases. This leads to misclassifications and an underestimation of biodiversity. Traditional bioinformatic pipelines are inadequate for discovering novel species, hindering accurate biodiversity assessments essential for conservation.

# Proposed Solution
Our pipeline offers a novel approach to address these issues:

Database-Independent Classification: Deep learning models are trained to identify and classify eukaryotic taxa without relying on complete reference databases.

Discovery of Novel Taxa: Unsupervised learning is used to cluster sequences, enabling the identification of new or unclassified species.

Efficient Workflow: The pipeline is designed to be computationally efficient, reducing the time required to process large eDNA datasets.

Biodiversity Assessment: The solution provides detailed information on species richness and community structure, offering insights for conservation.
